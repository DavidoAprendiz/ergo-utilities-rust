General utilities to make writing off-chain Ergo code in Rust simpler.

This library was born from abstracting out reusable components from the [Oracle Core](https://github.com/ergoplatform/oracle-core/). As such, it does not support currently aim to have full support for all relevant features. Features are currently added on an "as-needed" basis, though in the future building this out into a stable library may make sense.
