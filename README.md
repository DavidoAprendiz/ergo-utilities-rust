# Ergo Utilities
This repo houses experimental libraries for writing off-chain Ergo code in Rust.


## Current Libraries

### Ergo Off-Chain Utilities
Utilities related to interfacing with an Ergo Node, UTXO-set scanning, and various encoding/hashing/serialization functions.

### Ergo Protocol Framework
A framework which attempts to provide a guided approach to developing the off-chain portion of multi-stage smart contract protocols. The goal here is to provide developers with an easy experience to go from [Ergo dApp informal specifications]https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/blob/master/eip-0006.md) to off-chain code with greater assurance and a straightforward path of implementation.
